## Professional Journey

After 16 years leading financial operations for a major healthcare system—managing accounting, compliance, payroll, disbursements, and budget execution—I made a calculated pivot into advanced technology development. The timing aligned perfectly with Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) initiative, which offered a deferred resignation program that allowed me to transition from optimizing traditional financial systems to building the next generation of AI-powered, decentralized solutions.

This transition represented more than a career change; it was a strategic response to the convergence of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. My background in healthcare finance taught me that the most critical systems are those that handle real-world consequences—when lives and livelihoods depend on your decisions, you develop a particular approach to reliability engineering, security architecture, and system design that translates directly to building production-grade AI and blockchain solutions.

## Current Focus

**AI/ML Systems Architecture & Solana Ecosystem Development**

I'm currently architecting production-ready AI systems that solve real-world problems, with particular expertise in on-device machine learning, privacy-preserving inference, and the intersection of AI with high-performance blockchain technology.

## Development Philosophy and Perspective

My development philosophy centers on **systems thinking** and **reliability engineering** rather than just feature development. Every system I architect considers performance at scale, security by design (eliminating attack vectors architecturally), regulatory compliance, user experience excellence, production readiness (99.9% uptime with monitoring), and AI ethics/privacy.

The convergence of AI/ML and blockchain technology represents a paradigm shift in building intelligent, decentralized systems. My healthcare finance background informs how these can solve critical problems in regulated industries where trust, compliance, and performance are non-negotiable. Solana's high-performance, low-cost transactions enable AI-powered apps with real-time decision-making and micropayments, combining on-device AI for privacy with blockchain for trust.
