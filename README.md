## Professional Journey

After 16 years leading financial operations for a major healthcare systemâ€”managing accounting, compliance, payroll, disbursements, and budget executionâ€”I made a calculated pivot into blockchain technology. The timing aligned perfectly with Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) initiative, which offered a deferred resignation program that allowed me to transition from optimizing traditional financial systems to building the next generation of efficient, decentralized solutions. This transition represented more than a career change; it was a strategic response to the evolving landscape of decentralized systems and their potential to transform how we think about trust, ownership, and value exchange.

My background in healthcare finance taught me that the most critical systems are those that handle real-world consequences. When lives and livelihoods depend on your decisions, you develop a particular approach to risk management, compliance, and system architecture. These skills translate directly to building robust, scalable blockchain solutions.

## Current Focus

**Solana Development & Ecosystem Architecture**

I'm currently immersed in the Solana ecosystem, building production-ready programs and exploring the intersection of high-performance blockchain technology with real-world applications. My approach combines deep technical understanding with strategic thinking about how these technologies can solve genuine problems.

### Technical Competencies

**Core Development**
- **Rust** - Production-ready Solana programs, Anchor framework, no_std development, Pinocchio low-level development, applied in hackathon projects and production microservices
- **Solana Mobile SDK**: Offline-capable apps for real-world utility, as in crisis-companion hackathon entry
- **Scalable Security**: Rate limiting and observability in microservices, reducing downtime risks in high-stakes environments
- **TypeScript/JavaScript** - Full-stack dApp development, React/Next.js, wallet integration
- **Smart Contract Architecture** - Program design, security best practices, cross-program invocations
- **Blockchain Fundamentals** - Account models, transaction processing, consensus mechanisms
- **Microservices Architecture** - Service separation, inter-service communication, Docker containerization
- **Production Backend Systems** - Axum web framework, PostgreSQL, Redis, JWT authentication
- **Domain-Driven Design** - Clean architecture, trait-based abstractions, comprehensive error handling
- **Advanced Security Patterns** - Implementation of exploit-resistant designs including proper signer validation, overflow protection, and secure cross-program invocations

**Domain Expertise**
- **Financial Systems** - Complex accounting operations, regulatory compliance, risk management, with a strong security focus honed through years of auditing and protecting sensitive financial data
- **Healthcare Technology** - HIPAA compliance, audit functions, secure data handling
- **Blockchain Security** - Smart contract auditing and best practices (via RareSkills.io Rust Security Bootcamp and Ackee VSCode Security Extension contributions); implemented in production auth/app services with advanced features like JWT authentication, Argon2 hashing, and input validation
- **Smart Contract Auditing** - Trained in identifying critical vulnerabilities like missing ownership checks, integer overflows, and CPI attacks through RareSkills advanced security curriculum
- **Strategic Planning** - Budget execution, resource allocation, performance optimization
- **Team Leadership** - Cross-functional coordination, stakeholder management, process improvement
- **Enterprise Systems** - Production deployment, service orchestration, infrastructure management
- **Observability & Monitoring** - Structured logging, request tracing, error tracking

## Featured Projects

### [Live Accelerator Microservices Project](https://github.com/paragoner1/live-bootcamp-project)
**Production-grade authentication and application services**

- **Microservices Architecture**: Service separation, Docker containerization, inter-service communication
- **Authentication System**: JWT token management, Argon2 password hashing, secure session handling
- **Database Integration**: PostgreSQL with SQLx, Redis caching, database migrations
- **Production Deployment**: Docker Hub integration, environment configuration, service orchestration
- **Observability**: Structured logging, request tracing, comprehensive error handling
- **Scalable Security Integration**: Combined JWT/Argon2 with Redis for resilient, exploit-resistant auth systems
- **Impact**: Built for scalable authentication with rate limiting and advanced security, minimizing vulnerabilities through best practices like Argon2 hashing and input validation

## Strategic Approach

My development philosophy centers on **architectural thinking** rather than just coding. Every system I build considers:

- **Scalability**: How will this perform under real-world load?
- **Security**: What are the attack vectors and how do we mitigate them? Drawing from finance auditing, I prioritize exploit-resistant designs using tools like Argon2 and RareSkills best practices.
- **Compliance**: How does this integrate with existing regulatory frameworks?
- **User Experience**: How do we make complex technology accessible and valuable?
- **Production Readiness**: How do we ensure reliability, monitoring, and maintainability?
- **System Integration**: How do components work together in a distributed environment?

## Industry Perspective

The blockchain space is evolving rapidly, and Solana's approach to high-performance, low-cost transactions positions it uniquely for mainstream adoption. My background in healthcare finance gives me insight into how these technologies can solve real problems in regulated industries where trust, compliance, and performance are non-negotiable.
