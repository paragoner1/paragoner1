## Professional Journey

After 16 years leading financial operations for a major healthcare system—managing accounting, compliance, payroll, disbursements, and budget execution—I made a calculated pivot into advanced technology development. The timing aligned perfectly with Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) initiative, which offered a deferred resignation program that allowed me to transition from optimizing traditional financial systems to building the next generation of AI-powered, decentralized solutions.

This transition represented more than a career change; it was a strategic response to the convergence of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. My background in healthcare finance taught me that the most critical systems are those that handle real-world consequences—when lives and livelihoods depend on your decisions, you develop a particular approach to reliability engineering, security architecture, and system design that translates directly to building production-grade AI and blockchain solutions.

## Industry Perspective

The convergence of AI/ML and blockchain technology represents a paradigm shift in how we build systems that are both intelligent and decentralized. My unique background in healthcare finance provides insight into how these technologies can solve critical problems in regulated industries where trust, compliance, and performance are non-negotiable.

Solana's approach to high-performance, low-cost transactions positions it uniquely for AI-powered applications that require real-time decision making and micropayments. The combination of on-device AI for privacy and blockchain for trust creates unprecedented opportunities for applications that were previously impossible.
